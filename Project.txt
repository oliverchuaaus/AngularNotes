Pricehipster

Technical:
1. Scraper API: Jaunt
2. Need to add layer for pluggable custom scraping


1. Discount cycles are different (2 weeks chemist warehouse, 1 week supermarket)
2. Some catalogs are area specific

Current issues:
1. Some prices spikes up, then down. discount should not be relative to last price 
2. Same product on different supermarkets, treated as different
3. Some products are exclusive to a supermarket i.e. unique size but same product
4. Alerts only at the start of discount, better to have early alerts?
5. No login, relies on link from email. However, some proxy lose session so need to continually relogin
6. Not excluded if sold out
