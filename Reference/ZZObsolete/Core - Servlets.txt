Scope Objects
Web context	ServletContext
Session		HttpSession
Request		HttpServletRequest
Page		JspContext

PRG - post/redirect/get

JSTL - JSP Standard tag library c and fmt.

Advanced servlets
2 types of web applications
presentation-oriented
service-oriented

web Module packaging
Assembly root
	Jsp pages, etc.
	<WEB-INF>
		web.xml
		<lib>
		<classes>
		<tags>

query the request
block the request response pair from passing any further
modify request headers and data
modify response headers and data
interact with external resources

Filtering API
Filter

FilterConfig

JSP
Jsp fragment is .jspf

Unified expression language
union of JSP 2.0 EL and JSF 1.0 EL

features of UEL:
dynamically read application data stored in JavaBeans.
dynamically write data from forms into JavaBeans.
invoke static methods
dynamically perform arithmetic operations

Kinds of expressions
immediate or deferred evaluation expressions ${} vs #{}
value or method expression
Rvalue or Lvalue expression

Defered expressions can be value of method expressions
Value expressions can be rvalue or lvalue

VALUE:
customer.name is equal to customer["name"]
composite expressions - value="some#{expr}#{expr}text#{expr}"

METHOD:
value="#{bean.method}"

Functions vs. Methods
Functions are static method that return a value.
Functions statically defined at translation time.
Methods are dynamically defined at runtime.
Function params and invocations are part of an EL expression
Method params are part of the tag definition

Reusing content in JSP pages
include directive	<%@ include file="banner.jspf" %>
preludes and codas	
jsp:include element	<jsp:include page="response.jsp"/>


Types of atributes:
simple
fragment - portion of jsp code passed to tag handler
dynamic - attributes not defined in tag def
