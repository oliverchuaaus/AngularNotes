1. No entities being created in seam generate
the property in build.properties(populated in interview) named
hibernate.default_schema has a wrong value.
For H2, this should be left blank, or PUBLIC.

2. Error when running ant explode in seam folder.
ant's default goal is deploy, and it deploys file project.ear
ant explode goal will deploy a folder named project.ear
When ant deploy is called first, then ant explode, 
there will be an error since in windows, a folder cannot have the same name as a file.

3. When seam generate is ran, the folder is not deployed in jboss server,
but a similar directory structure is created inside the seam folder.
Solution: <seam-dir>/build.properties needs to be changed like so
jboss.home=c\:/java/jboss-5.1.0.GA
Take note that the separator is / and not \.
If you prefer to use \, escape like so \\.

4. Endless redeployment loop 
http://seamframework.org/Documentation/WhatHappensWhenYouDeploySeamAppInJBoss5 
JBoss 5.1 has a known redeployment issue when deploying applications via Eclipse. 
This causes an application to be in a continuous redeployment loop.
Solution:Delete the temp file that gets created by the IDE each time the application is deployed to the server via IDE : 
         \jboss\server\default\deploy\<application>.ear\<application>.war\WEB-INF\.pages.xml.spdia
Note : This won’t occur If the application is deployed via “seam-gen”.

5. jdbc driver not found in jboss startup
seam generate copies the jar to jboss/server/default/lib
However, if you switch and don't rerun generate,
you have copy the file manually.
Hsql driver is supported by default and is in jboss/common/lib

6. How to add serialVersionUID in generated classes?
http://code.google.com/p/seaminaction/wiki/SeamGenEnhancements
Add Pojo.ftl to seam/seam-gen/pojo for the model classes as per link
with the following contents:

${pojo.getPackageDeclaration()}
// Generated ${date} by Hibernate Tools ${version}
<#assign classbody>
<#include "PojoTypeDeclaration.ftl"/> {
<#if !pojo.isInterface()>
private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
<#include "PojoFields.ftl"/>
<#include "PojoConstructors.ftl"/>
<#include "PojoPropertyAccessors.ftl"/>
<#include "PojoToString.ftl"/>
<#include "PojoEqualsHashcode.ftl"/>
<#else>
<#include "PojoInterfacePropertyAccessors.ftl"/>
</#if>
<#include "PojoExtraClassCode.ftl"/>
}
</#assign>
${pojo.generateImports()}
${classbody}


For the action classes,
seam/seam-gen/src/EntityHome.java.ftl and seam/seam-gen/src/EntityList.java.ftl
insert after the class declaration the following line:

private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
