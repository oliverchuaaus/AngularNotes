JAX-WS - Java API for XML Web Services

XML over HTTP vs. HTML over HTTP

Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)
The Web Service Discovery Tool (DISCO)
Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI)
Web Service Discovery Language (WSDL). 

These are the basic steps for creating the web service and client:
1. Code the implementation class.
2. Compile the implementation class.
3. Use wsgen to generate the artifacts required to deploy the service.
4. Package the files into a WARfile.
5. Deploy the WAR file. The web service artifacts (which are used to communicate with
clients) are generated by the Application Server during deployment.
6. Code the client class.
7. Use wsimport to generate and compile the web service artifacts needed to connect to the
service.
8. Compile the client class.
9. Run the client.


I. SOAP message
  A. SOAP part
    1. SOAP envelope
      a. SOAP header (optional)
	b. SOAP body
	
WSDL Tags
Service   = Application Server
Port      = Component
Binding   = marshalling ,transport
Port Type = Interface
Operation = Function
Message   = parameter
Type 	  = Declaration Section


SOA Principles:	
Reuse complex and simple types across services
When searching, retrieve list of records with pk.
Limit list to max items.
Use pk to retrieve more details.
Version web services to support backward capability

Composability - new services reuse existing services
Statelessness - for scalability
Loose coupling - so services can be reused
