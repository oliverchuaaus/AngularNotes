Workaround: add navigation rule in faces-config.xml and set redirect to true
or add ?faces-redirect=true to navigate string in ManagedBean.

8. Target Unreachable, identifier 'unitAddBean' resolved to null
Workaround: define bean sin faces-config.xml

9. Required does not trim, 
use Converter to trim and register

Eclipse Maven
1. How to make maven project deployable in wtp web server?
Not possible.
When web app facet added to project, it can be deployed, 
but the maven libraries are not included.

Solution 1:
Use tomcat-maven-plugin to deploy maven project to web server
Setup Eclipse tomcat server, enable tomcat manager application
Downside is there is no hot deploy when files change
Source: https://wiki.base22.com/display/btg/How+to+create+a+Maven+web+app+and+deploy+to+Tomcat+-+fast

Additional: point to tomcat manager:
Place manager.xml in C:\Mine\Sandbox\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.wst.server.core\tmp0\conf\Catalina\localhost
with the following contents:
<Context path="/manager" privileged="true"
         docBase="C:\Java\apache-tomcat-7.0.14\webapps\manager">
</Context>

Additional: for tomcat 7, use following for tomcat-users.xml
<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<role rolename="manager-script"/>
<user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui,manager-script"/>
Additional: for tomcat 7, 
use http://localhost:9090/manager/text
Source: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3714080/tomcat-7-maven-plugin


Solution 2:
Use solution 1 with Manik
http://www.imixs.org/manik.updatesite/site.xml
Target folder:
C:\Mine\Sandbox\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.wst.server.core\tmp0\webapps\MyIntranet
Source: http://code.google.com/p/manik-hot-deploy/

To summarise:
Deploy using maven, do not add to server in Servers tab.
Whenever files are updated, they are deployed to the target folder file per file.

2. Warning
Classpath entry org.maven.ide.eclipse.MAVEN2_CLASSPATH_CONTAINER will not be exported or published. Runtime ClassNotFoundExceptions may result.  
   1. Open the properties of the project that generates this warning
   2. Click on "Java Build Path"
   3. Click on the tab "Order and Export"
   4. Enable "Maven Dependencies"
   5. Click on "Ok"
   6. Open the "Problems" view
   7. Select the warning we are trying to solve, and press "Ctrl-1", click "exclude..."
   8. Click on "Ok"

3. Build Goals
Ability to hot deploy to server via eclipse
Ability to maven deploy to server
command line maven and m2eclipse should run the same

Ability to run unit tests in eclipse
Ability to run unit tests in maven

Maintain one version of resources for local and deployed app:
persistence.xml
spring.xml

Scripts to: 
delete tables - auto
create tables - auto
recreate sequences - auto

3 profiles:
one local per dev need to overwrite settings, includes hudson
one server

Auto-complete for JSF

4. Running unit test and no unit test showing up in UnitTest tab.
Solution: Add Junit libraries in Project Build Path

5. Running unit test and error: Unknown entity.
persistence.xml in test/resources
should be in main/resources

Java class with annotation to persistence
should be in main/java

DBUnit
1. How to access xml file from classpath?
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1464291/how-to-really-read-text-file-from-classpath-in-java

2. Unique constraint issues:
Set sequence to higher number than highest test data.
However, when database is refreshed, sequence not updated to latest.

3. Foreign Key constraint issues:
???

4. hibernate3-maven-plugin hangs for 3 mins before going to hbm2ddl

5. Intermittent ORA-12519 error on 10g XE 
In brief: It's a bug in how the connections are monitored solved by increasing the processes parameter i.e. ALTER SYSTEM SET PROCESSES=150 SCOPE=SPFILE and then restart the db.

Eclipse
1. When copying existing project but changing webapp name,
change in org.eclipse.wst.common.component file that is in the .settings directory of the project.
Some cannot be changed inside Eclipse
Source: http://www.corneliadavis.com/blog/index.php/2010/01/all-the-little-references-when-you-copy-an-eclipse-project/

2. Debugger stops in ThreadPoolExecutor
in the Preferences Dialog, the Debug pane under Java in the tree hierarchy, has the option titled "Suspend execution on uncaught exceptions", which can be unchecked.
Source: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6290470/eclipse-debugger-always-blocks-on-threadpoolexecutor-without-any-obvious-exceptio














Best Practices
1. Name props as [module]Prop to avoid confusion with objects
JPA object unit.unitName vs Msg Property unit.unitName
so for Property, use unitProp.unitName
2. Don't place properties in one single file
3. IDEA:
There are critical paths in the app.
These lets you create objects, etc. towards a goal.
These operations should be part of the build to make sure no bug becomes a blocker
All other are just validations of invalid values.







Pending:
Make Spring DI work in ManagedBean - NOT WORKING!
Make pagination table as Request scope - NOT WORKING!
	and make commandLink submit all form elements instead of just params 
Make navigation to action work (instead of to viewId/jsf) - NOT WORKING!
	so that after add, new unit shows up in the list, and update link show existing data
Make composite component work using Address
