M2Eclipse:
Warning in console after opening eclipse.
Eclipse is running in a JRE, but a JDK is required
Some Maven plugins may not work when importing projects or updating source folders.
Solution: Add this to eclipse.ini 
-vm 
C:\Java\jdk6u14\bin
It has to be on two separate lines for it to work.
Also, these lines has to be before -vmargs

A Java Project can be Mavenized just by adding a pom.xml, right click on Project>Maven>Enable Dependency Management. Src folders will need to be added manually
Dependencies specified in the pom.xml will then be added under Maven dependencies as jars
This will be enough for projects not needing to run mvn install

Maven dependencies in the package explorer are not sorted, so it is hard to find jars.
You can go to Dependency Hierarchy tab in pom viewer, the right panel has the list sorted.

By default, the maven installation will rely on C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\.m2\settings.xml
for proxy settings. This will not be available and so if a proxy server is needed, build will fail.
To fix, copy settings.xml from C:\Java\apache-maven-2.2.1\conf and specify proxy server

To run mvn install in M2Eclipse, right-click on pom.xml or project>Run as>mvn install

When running build in Eclipse, you get
[INFO] Cannot copy a directory: D:\Sandbox\openejb\openejb-jar\target\classes; Did you package/install active 
project artifact:
 artifact = active project artifact:
 artifact = org.kristoffer:openejb-jar:ejb:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT:compile;
 project: MavenProject: org.kristoffer:openejb-jar:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT @ D:\Sandbox\openejb\openejb-jar\pom.xml;
 project: MavenProject: org.kristoffer:openejb-jar:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT @ D:\Sandbox\openejb\openejb-jar\pom.xml?
Reason: http://www.innovationontherun.com/common-issues-and-workarounds-while-building-ear-files-in-eclipse/
A bug on the Resolve workspace artifacts. Just removing it will solve the problem.
2 ways:
1. Whenever you run a lifecycle phase (install, compile, etc), uncheck Resolve workspace artifacts in 
configurations, as in the url above
2. Easiest way, for each project, right click on Maven, then Disable Workspace resolution.

Eclipse project lose empty src folders after update.
Cause: There was an SVN conflict. 
Solution: Resolve conflict then refresh project.
You may have to restart eclipse
If compile errors are still there, try refreshing.

What's a good reference for M2Eclipse?
http://www.sonatype.com/books/m2eclipse-book/reference/

1. When we update to head the parent pom, does it cascade down? Yes
2. When we refresh the parent pom, does it refresh all? No."

To convert Java project to Maven project
right click on project > configure > convert to Maven project

To update Maven project's libraries after changing pom.xml
right click on project > Maven > Update Dependencies

Eclipse Maven Update issue:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14149545/java-security-cert-certificateexception-certificates-does-not-conform-to-algori
1. In chrome, open https://repo.maven.apache.org/ 
click flag > details > view certificate > details > copy to file > save as c:\temp\maven.cer
2. In cmd
\work\jdk1.8.0_101\bin\keytool -importcert -file C:\temp\maven.cer -keystore C:\Work\jre8\lib\security\cacerts
3. Update C:\Work\jre8\lib\security\java.security
remove MD5 and DH from disabled properties
jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, RSA keySize < 1024
jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, keySize < 768
4. If it still fails in eclipse, run mvn install in cmd.
it should download files into repository.
