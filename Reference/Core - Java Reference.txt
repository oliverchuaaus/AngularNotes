Theory:
There are two types of Date objects: java.sql (without time) and java.util (with time)
When parsing 
java.util.Date date = DateFormat.parse("2010-02-28");
it sets the time to current time,
so be careful if you rely on exact match of the date only.
If the field is date only, better to convert it to a java.sql.Date
java.sql.Date date = new java.sql.Date(utilDate.getTime());
